# SoundScript

A system for modelling sounds based on a simple scripting language.

Inspired by [Sound Toy](http://www.iquilezles.org/apps/soundtoy/).

This implements a scripting language, a virtual machine, and a sound generator.
It is planned to add support for general user-provided inputs (probably through
a text-based format as well as MIDI down the road).

At some point I'd like to turn this into a Discord Bot.
